<h2>Therapy Podcast</h2>

<p>I enjoy podcasts and started thinking of creating a therapy podcast back in 2013. I was working full-time, a full-time daddy (my favourite and most important role) and spreading myself across a number of other things. I then became single in 2014 and had other things upon which to focus. Creating a podcast became a lesser priority.</p>

<h2>Counselling and Therapeutic Modalities</h2>

<p>Since I became a counsellor back in 2009, I have bounced a bit between modalities. As a student, the emphasis was upon Carl Rogers' Person Centered Therapy. This is a good starting point, but just that - a place to start. I then became interested in the various iterations of Cognitive Therapy (Cognitive Therapy, Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy, Rational-Emotive Behavioural Therapy), but they didn't seem enough. I then chanced upon Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy and felt this covered a few more bases in the approach I wanted to use. Then there was Narrative Therapy and Compassion-Focused Therapy (among many others).</p>

<h2>Narrative Therapy</h2>

<p>I began to consider that Narrative Therapy could be a framework from which I would work, supplemented by other modalities and tools - meditation, compassion meditation, cognitive therapeutic work, etc. I took a course last year in Adelaide, Australia, at the Centre where Narrative Therapy began. I continued to consider the possibilities after this course.</p>

<h2>Our Narratives</h2>

<p>The lock-down of COVID-19 has given me time to further explore possibilities. I have been working on audio resources for meditation and other things that might help others during self-isolation. Yesterday, I created a podcast and will be migrating some of these resources to that podcast.</p>

<p>The podcast is available at:</p>

<p>Content will be added over the following weeks, but I anticipate Narrative Therapy theory and sessions, guided meditation (mindfulness, compassion and chanting) and poetry that I might want to read.</p>

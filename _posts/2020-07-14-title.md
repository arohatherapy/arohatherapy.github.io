<h2>Positive Psychology</h2>

<p>At the start of the 21st Century, a few psychologists realised what had already kept many of us out of traditional psychology - that there was an emphasis on pathology in psychology. A field of study that grew primarily out of medicine could be excused for looking at what is "broken", but there was a realisation by those like Martin Seligman that there was no focus on what was needed for our best lives.</p>

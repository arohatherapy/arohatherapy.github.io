<h2>We Build Our Lives Around Us</h2>

<p>This quote strikes me with its visualisation and insight - we create our world with our actions, including our words.</p> 

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="100%"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;The words you speak become the house in which you live.&quot; ~Hafiz</p>&mdash; Therapy Aroha ❤️ (@therapyaroha) <a href="https://twitter.com/therapyaroha/status/1282897478317031424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </p> 

<h2>Creating Your Life</h2>

<p>Is your life what you wanted to create? If not, you still have time to make the world in which you want to live.</p>

Hello and welcome to the first episode of Our Narratives.

This podcast is being created as a resource for those seeking to improve their own mental health. We cannot all afford weekly sessions of therapy, but we all need help at some time. I have been in this situation myself, raising a small child with limited support and even more limited funds.

After getting through my difficulties - in fact while in them - I decided that I wanted to help others. I was a week into single life, camping with my son. I say "camping", but we were living in a caravan only two months after the purchase of a home. It was very late at night and as my four year old son feel asleep next to me, I had a moment of clarity and realised that I would become a therapist. I heard a coyote howl in the distance and then drifted off to sleep, my first peaceful moment in weeks.

Out of that experience, I did a Master of Counselling course and I began telephone counselling training in Christchurch Aotearoa New Zealand. I threw myself into this new life, looking forward to when I could help others who were suffering.

Over time I realised that one therapist can definitely help, but help only a few in traditional practice. Western therapy is modelled largely after 19th Century medical visits.

<h2>My Online Portfolio</h2>

I am creating this site to showcase my professional life - an online C.V. of sorts. I hope to be able to include more information than on my C.V., including showcasing some of my projects. Ultimately, this site will be a place where I can direct others interested in my work. 

Note that this site should be reviewed in tandem with my business site in order to see what is happening in my professional world.
